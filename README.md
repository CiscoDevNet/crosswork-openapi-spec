This repository stores publicly downloadable copies of Cisco Crosswork API Swagger documentation. All the Swagger files here are linked from config.json files on https://pubhub.cisco.com/detail/727, which are published to the primary public site,Â https://developer.cisco.com/docs/crosswork/.

If you are a Cisco Crosswork API engineer, make sure you upload to this site ONLY Swagger documentation for APIs that are:
1. Cisco intellectual property.
2. Public, meaning that they are part of a Cisco Crosswork software product release that has undergone a formal FCS, has been approved for release, and that has been released to customers.

DO NOT upload API Swagger documentation to this repository for:
A. Non-Cisco APIs (such as IETF APIs). They are not Cisco IP and publishing them to Cisco DevNet as though they were may cause legal problems for Cisco. You may insert links to public documentation for non-Cisco APIs in your Swagger files, but do not upload that non-Cisco API documentation or code to this repo.
B. Cisco product APIs that are not part of the Cisco Crosswork product suite. You may link to them from your Swagger docs instead.
C. Crosswork APIs that are not yet public. Upload these to the Crosswork API documentation sandbox site, at https://pubhub.cisco.com/detail/2685.
D. Crosswork APIs that are for Cisco internal use only. Upload these to the Crosswork internal API documentation site at https://pubhub.cisco.com/detail/3042.
