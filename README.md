REPLACEMENT README

This repository stores publicly downloadable copies of Cisco Crosswork API Swagger documentation. All the Swagger files presented on the primary public site,Â https://developer.cisco.com/docs/crosswork/, are stored here, and linked from config.json files on the primary public site. This was done to ensure that non-Cisco users can safely download copies of our Swagger files.
If you are a Cisco developer, make sure you upload to this site ONLY documentation for APIs (a) that are Cisco intellectual property (b) that are public (that is, for software products that have been formally FCSed and released to the field). Do not upload API documentation for non-Cisco APIs (such as IETF APIs) or APIs that have no yet been released.
